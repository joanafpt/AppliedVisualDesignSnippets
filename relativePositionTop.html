<!--Applied Visual Design: Change an Element's Relative Position-->
<!--Change the position of the h2 to relative, and use a CSS offset to move it 15 pixels away from the top of where it sits in the normal flow.-->

<style>
    h2 {
      position: relative;
      top: 15px;
      
    }
  </style>
  <body>
    <h1>On Being Well-Positioned</h1>
    <h2>Move me!</h2>
    <p>I still think the h2 is where it normally sits.</p>
  </body>
