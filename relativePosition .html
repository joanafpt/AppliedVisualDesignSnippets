<!--Applied Visual Design: Move a Relatively Positioned Element with CSS Offsets-->
<!--Use CSS offsets to move the h2 15 pixels to the right and 10 pixels up.-->
<!-- IMPORTANT: You're offsetting an element away from a given spot, which moves the element away from the referenced side (effectively, the opposite direction).-->

<head>
<style>
  h2 {
    position: relative;
    left: 15px;
    bottom: 10px;    
    
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>On Being Well-Positioned</h1>
  <h2>Move me!</h2>
  <p>I still think the h2 is where it normally sits.</p>
</body>
